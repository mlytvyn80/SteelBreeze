Dear Dr. Nurutdinov,

   I received your telemail message and attempted to fax the
information you requested, but with no success.  Therefore,
I retyped it on my computer (it originally was typed on an
old-fashioned electric typewriter!), and so now I can simply
e-mail it to you.  This should be better, actually, since
now we do not have to worry about print quality from the
fax machines.

Sincerely,

Michael D. Abell

    Notes:

 1. All values should include a decimal point or be right-hand justified in
    the indicated fields.

 2. Station coordinates are given in a Greenwich right-hand Cartesian
    coordinate system (e.g., Z-axis toward the CIO pole, X-axis toward
    the Greenwich meridian and Y-axis toward the 90 deg. east meridian).

 3. Source coordinates are given in J2000.0 coordinates using the IAU 1984
    definitions for precession, nutation, aberration, etc.

 4. The reference frequency is defined as the frequency to which the total
    fringe phase observable (Card #4) is referred.

 5. The epoch of the observation is defined as the UTC epoch at which the
    signal arrived at site 1; i.e., the site identified in columns 1-8 of
    card #1.

 6. The sequence number in columns 71-78 of the data cards is to be the same
    number for each data card associated with a given observation.  The
    numbers in columns 79-80 serve to sequence the cards within a given
    observation.

 7. The delay is defined as:

                    D = T2 - T1

    where

                   T1 = time of signal arrival at site 1 as measured
                        by the site clock at site 1
                   T2 = time of signal arrival at site 2 as measured
                        by the site clock at site 2

    No calibration corrections (e.g. atmosphere corrections) have been added
    to or subtracted from these values.

 8. The delay rate is defined as the derivative of delay with respect to time
    as measured by the clock at site 1.

 9. The sense of the cable calibration is that an increase means an increase
    in the (one-way) electrical length of the cable carrying the phase
    calibration signal to the receiver box.

10. The barometric pressure should not be corrected to sea level.

11. It is not necessary to include blank data cards for missing data.  For
    example, if no meteorological data are available, card #6 may be deleted.

12. Card #1 may not be deleted.

13. Data should be arranged in time order.

14. If the cards are put on tape, the tape should be 9 track with the
    following DCB:

                   DCB = (RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=3200)
